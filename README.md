# The Application of Deep Learning Technology for Reading Water Meter using CiRA CORE
These codes are used in [this project](https://github.com/redsoul2032/detect_meterwater_cira)
to read water meters using CiRA CORE with the following details:
1. Program to rotate images 90 and 180 degrees.
2. Program to adjust the image angle to the correct position.
3. Rearrange the output numbers from the detection.
4. Convert the detected dial values to numbers.
5. Combine all output.
6. Save data to excel.
7. Check upload status.
8. Upload the file to Google Drive.
